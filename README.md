Gaussian Process

MO435 - Machine Learning Probabilistic Fundamentals


This repository contains the first project of the Unsupervised Learning course taken at the Computational Institute of the University of Campinas.

Code in python and report in latex.

The purpuse of the project is to implement Gaussian Process used in unsupervided learning.

See the project02.pdf for more details.
